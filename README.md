# Overlook Hotel

This webpage is based off the book "The Shinning". 

## Description

I developed this Overlook Hotel webpage, pulling information from a application programming interface that has six arrays of objects. This webpage was built using react. There is a navigation bar at the top of the page that changes the url when clicking on one of the six options. The home page has some photo's built into the background and information about the hotel. The images has a lot of images of the hotel. The rooms tab has information and images of the rooms. The ghosts tabs has a running timer on it since the last time there was a sighting of any ghost at the hotel. In the guest tab, it shows all the guest staying at the hotel and future bookings. In the final bookings tab, there is a spot to book a room where the customer can decide when they are staying and be able to see an estimated cost of their hotel room.

## Features

* On the loading of the home page there are tabs in the upper right hand conner, to navigate to different parts of the page.
* On the rooms tab, there are four buttons in the upper left hand corner. On clicking on one of the buttons it will only show the rooms that correlate with that button.
* In the ghosts tab, there is a counting up timer at the top of the page. Once a user clicks on one of the sighting buttons under each ghost. It adds to the number of the sightings and restarts timer at zero.
* In the guests tab, there is a check out button. By clicking on the button it will delete the guest from the API.
* In the bookings tab, when changing the dates, it will display the starting cost for the room. If the user tries to submit with check in equal or later than check in, it will display a message until check out is later than check in.
